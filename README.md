## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55026293/google-chrome-javascript-issue-in-getting-user-audio-the-audiocontext-was-not
https://www.mikedane.com/web-development/javascript/getting-user-input/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I found getting used to the javascript coding format to pose somewhat a challenge, so I resorted to forums via Google for better reference.
I found the code syntax pertaining to my problems (such as if statements and while loops) to be similar to languages I am already familiar with,
which made learning the code format easier than I initially expected.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Completing this project has made me more curious about learning html, js and css. I am interested in the extent of javascript's
 user capabilities, as well as the range of design formatting that is possible using html. I am curious as to how more advanced webpages
 can be created and tinkered with.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I felt that the webpage design was flat during the project, so I would work on developing a more engaging site environment for the user.
I would like to have come up with an enticing background color scheme, with more aesthetically pleasing buttons and text displayed to the user.
The game would also have run for a much longer period of time, and record keeping would have been added for the user to retain their high scores.]
